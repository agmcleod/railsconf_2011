Big Lebowski references FTW.

autocomplete: prefix-based suggestions (Google, search.usa.gov).

autosuggest: more complicated, not necessarily prefix-based suggestions
  (Facebook, Quora, Bing). Look for "weather #{zip_code}" on Bing.

Important: When rolling your own autocomplete, make sure to set :autocomplete =>
  'off' in your text field, to keep the browser from jacking your autocomplete
  its self.
